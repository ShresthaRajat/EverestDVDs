# EverestDVDs
Barebone project for the Application Development Groupwork to create a functional Web application for basic CRUD operation with UAC for different users.


## 1. Getting Started:


> Clone this repo on "Clone or checkout code". [Alt: Download the zip file, unzip and open the solution]
```

```
> Log into the Github to get collaboration access. 

> Create a separate branch and push the changes on that specific branch only. [Important!]



## 2. Rules:

### Do:
* Create a separate branch by your name for a specific function. ("git checkout -b yourname" or just create a new branch)

* Submit a pull request at dev after the function is complete.

## Not to Do:
* Do not touch any other files other than the files related to the task assigned to you.
* Do not push any commits directly on the master branch.
* Do not create unnecessary files.
* Do not make changes to create potential merge conflicts.
